# Computer Vision tasks

- Each task has it's own folder, with an own `index.html` file
- In order check out a task you either have to:
	a. go to [http://janmonschke.com/ComputerVision/FOLDERNAME](http://janmonschke.com/ComputerVision/FOLDERNAME) e.g. for the first task -> [http://janmonschke.com/ComputerVision/01_Edge_Detection](http://janmonschke.com/ComputerVision/01_Edge_Detection)
	b. or go to your Terminal and cd into this root folder. In the root folder run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` which will start a file server accessible at the following url: [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)
